# EyeMine

Want to play Minecraft with your eyes?? [EyeMine](https://github.com/SpecialEffect/EyeMine) combines a modified version of Minecraft with a bespoke eye-gaze interface to enable people with disabilities to explore, craft and build in Minecraft. 

## Information for users

[**The EyeMine wiki**](https://github.com/SpecialEffect/EyeMine/wiki) contains full information on how to get started, system requirements, a user guide, demo videos, a troubleshooting page, and more.

## Information for developers

This is a fork of [OptiKey](https://github.com/OptiKey/OptiKey/wiki) which adds Minecraft-specific functionality. This makes up the eye-gaze-keyboard part of EyeMine, but EyeMine also requires Minecraft Forge with extra mods installed to add special functionality and extra key bindings. These are available at ([https://github.com/SpecialEffect/EyeMineMods](https://github.com/SpecialEffect/EyeMineMods)).

### Branches

The latest official version of EyeMine is available on the branch [eyemineV2](https://github.com/SpecialEffect/EyeMine/tree/eyemineV2). This includes some new functionality from OptiKey (in particular some excellent new support for users to customise their keyboards). The accompanying mod supports Minecraft Forge 1.14.4 and includes some new features such as building and mining with dwell. This can be found at [eyemineV2_mc1_14_4](https://github.com/SpecialEffect/EyeMineMods/tree/eyemineV2_mc1_14_4).

The original version of EyeMine is still available on the branch [eyemineClassic](https://github.com/SpecialEffect/EyeMine/tree/eyemineClassic). This is still maintained and will receive bug-fixes as appropriate. It is based on an earlier version of OptiKey, and supports Minecraft Forge v1.11.2 using the mod at [eyemineClassic_mc1_11_2](https://github.com/SpecialEffect/EyeMineMods/tree/eyemineClassic_mc1_11_2)

For any more recent Minecraft versions using [the mod pack on CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/eyemine-pack) it is expected that users use EyeMineV2.
